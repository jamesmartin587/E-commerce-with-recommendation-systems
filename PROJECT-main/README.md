User manual

Firstly, download the zip file of the project from the main branch of the gitlab page. 
Since this program was not deployed, an IDE is required to run this software which I have chosen as Microsoft Visual Studio Code, therefore must be downloaded from this website, depending on the operating system you are using will depend on which option you will download:  https://code.visualstudio.com/download, you can also use guides only to help you since there is an abundance if you search Microsoft visual studios download + the OS you are working on. 
Once the IDE is setup, unzip the project. To load the project into a working environment, click on File, at the top left corner.
 
Then click on folder opener.
 
And locate the folder we need, which is the folder inside the unzipped main folder therefore, not the first one.
 
But clicking this folder giving the next folder deep.
 
And click select folder. 
Then open a terminal (which if it isn’t already open) by clicking at the top of the menu – ‘terminal’

(Optional) Create and run a virtual environment

Run 'pip install -r requirements.txt'

And to run the system, type in the terminal, 'python manage.py runserver' will run the program on your browser at http://localhost:8000
